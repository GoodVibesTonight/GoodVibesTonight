ðŸ‘‹ **Hello there**... General Kenobi >>:)

**Currently:**
 I'm a beginning programmer with experience in C++, HTML/CSS, Bash, Typescript, Javascript, and MySQL.
     - Still learning :)

**Bio:**
 I'm not really one for talking about myself, I love learning about cybersecurity, network administration, and IT in general.
    If you are looking to collaborate or just to talk send me a pm! :)
